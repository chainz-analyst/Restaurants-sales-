☀️ Sunny Days Sell More — With or Without Promo

Sunny days accounted for the highest total sales, even without any promotions.

Promotions had less impact on sunny days, suggesting strong natural demand.

With Promo: 6,434 units in just 111 days


Conclusion: Promotions increase sales velocity, even if the quantity sold is lower.


🌧️ Rainy Days Underperform
